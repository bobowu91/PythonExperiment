Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who indeed has become the loudest voice in attacking China's behavior amid the coronavirus pandemic. In an interview, Mr. Cotton doesn't mince words about what he thinks this crisis has revealed about China -- or how the U.S. should respond.", "\"More Americans than ever, like more Asians than ever, recognize that China is a pariah state, and we ought to treat them like a pariah state,\" he says.", "But Mr. Cotton isn't just one more voice in a growing chorus of China bashers. He actually has a plan to do something. It's broad and expensive, and is explicitly designed to take advantage of the crisis to roll back Chinese power.", "More than that, Mr. Cotton has the ear of President Trump and the State Department, so it's important to look at what he's proposing as a sign of where the policy debate is heading.", "At the same time, the Cotton plan also begs the question of whether demonizing China will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Does treating China as a mortal enemy reflect a new reality, or does it create that reality at a time when a more benign course is still possible.", "Mr. Cotton's proposals are rooted in how he explains China's behavior. He strongly suspects the virus was released accidentally by a Chinese lab in the city of Wuhan. He acknowledges the evidence for that is only circumstantial.", "More than that, though, he argues that once the virus was on the loose, China made a conscious choice not to close off its country to prevent the virus's spread, but rather to let it spread \"to ensure the Chinese economy wasn't the only one to suffer.\"", "With the crisis now unleashed, Mr. Cotton argues, China's goal is to take advantage of it to push the U.S. out of the Western Pacific, intimidate its neighbors and force reunification with Taiwan. In other words, he argues, having created a global crisis, China now is attempting to capitalize on that crisis.", "His proposed response is encapsulated first and foremost in a new $43 billion piece of legislation he has proposed, called the FORCE Act. That's the Forging Operational Resistance to Chinese Expansion Act, and the title captures its goal and scope.", "Mr. Cotton would spend billions to build up joint military capabilities with allies in the region. He wants to build a new submarine and more jet fighters to project American power into the Pacific, and build up missile defenses in the region.", "His legislation also proposes spending billions to counteract disruptions to the defense industrial base caused by the virus, and to develop new sources of components so the U.S. isn't dependent on single manufacturers. And it would spend $12 billion to improve America's electrical grid and satellite operations and protect them from attack -- presumably Chinese attack.", "Those aren't the only moves Mr. Cotton advocates. He proposes other steps to address what he calls \"longstanding problems\" unrelated to the crisis: \"I believe there will be more political support now.\"", "He wants to put more midrange missiles in Asia, based on American territory in Guam and perhaps in allied countries as well, to counter Chinese midrange missiles. He would accelerate arms sales to Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province.", "He wants to make it easier for pharmaceutical and medical-supply companies to move manufacturing out of China and back to the U.S., in part by allowing them to immediately write off capital expenditures made in doing so. Beyond that, and more broadly, he cites a new government fund Japan has established to help Japanese companies move manufacturing supply chains out of China and back to Japan, and says the U.S. ought to consider a similar step.", "These all would be risky moves. Demonizing China may simply bolster the position of hard-liners within Beijing, who will see in them justification for their own preference for confrontation rather than cooperation with the U.S. Decoupling economically can cause as much disruption for America as for China. Beijing's leaders have made clear that arming Taiwan is a bright red line for them.", "Ultimately, cold confrontation can lead to hot war. Mr. Cotton counters: \"History shows time and time again the way to avoid such things is to draw clear lines about the kind of behavior we won't tolerate.\"", "Not many in Washington want to go as far as Mr. Cotton in drawing such lines.

The reason is that, if all of a worker's past earnings are indexed to the national average wage in the year he turns 60, a fall in national average wages in that year reduces Social Security's indexed measure of all of his past earnings. This produces a lower calculation of career average earnings, and thus a lower Social Security benefit.", "I estimate these effects in a working paper published by the Pension Research Council at the Wharton School of Business.

This would negate most of the hit to current 60-year-olds, but Americans turning 60 next year would see benefit cuts instead.", "Better would be for Social Security to abandon wage-indexing of past earnings. Instead of paying a typical retiree a benefit equal to 40% of wage-indexed career average earnings, Social Security might pay 50% of inflation-indexed average earnings. For a low-wage earner, Social Security's replacement rate would rise to 67% from 55%. If Social Security benefits were based on inflation-adjusted earnings, this Covid quirk could not occur.", "But if a typical retiree needs a replacement rate of 70% and Social Security provides 50%, it's harder to say that there's a retirement-savings crisis that demands expanding Social Security.

My interest was piqued when Brian Benczkowski, head of Justice's criminal division, announced recently that the department had already uncovered signs of possible fraud by applicants for Paycheck Protection Program loans. (The investigation is being conducted by Justice's Fraud Section, where I used to work as a prosecutor.)

It was also unusual for a Justice Department that has been more focused than its predecessors on whether investigations are properly \"predicated\" -- whether there is a sufficient factual basis to believe criminal misconduct occurred -- before taking any investigative steps, like requesting data from banks.", "Nonetheless, Justice did have a motive to announce its progress in this case, and it is disconcerting.", "The investigation and disclosures appear to have been influenced by the public backlash that resulted after large companies like Shake Shack and Ruth's Chris obtained loans through the PPP, along with other companies that could have raised funds through capital markets. There is virtually no chance that those companies will be prosecuted for their loan applications because, as the Journal's editorial board and many others have noted, they were entirely consistent with the language of the PPP. It's also clear that Congress intended for large restaurant chains to be able to receive the grants. The Treasury Department essentially conceded this point when it later amended its guidance to state that it was unlikely that a public company with a large market capitalization or access to capital markets should qualify for a loan, since it coupled that amendment with a safe harbor that is open through May 14 for businesses to return their loans.", "The Justice Department nevertheless seems primed to produce some scalps for the public. (Federal prosecutors charged two Rhode Island businessmen last week with fraud for overreporting their employee count to increase their loan, though that case was initiated by an informant tip rather than Justice's general review of the PPP.) As the investigation proceeds, there is a significant risk that it will ensnare desperate proprietors of small businesses who were rushing to tap a finite and insufficient liquidity source -- one that was open for a short period with no guarantee that more money would be available in the future -- and who struggled through a hurried approval process.

Technical challenges like these -- plus the struggle to navigate reams of Treasury guidance that seemed to change by the day -- will make it difficult to distinguish intentional misconduct from honest mistakes.

That has been borne out by data from the Federal Trade Commission, which has seen a tenfold increase in reports of coronavirus-related fraud over the past seven weeks -- now totaling more than 40,000 -- with an average loss of $500.

Four Amazon workers have reportedly died from the virus. And Amazon has fired at least four workers who protested against company policies during the pandemic. Vermont Sen.

Mr. Gee and Ms. Anguiano weave dozens of harrowing and heart-rending survivor accounts and expert opinions into a crisp, intimate portrait of the catastrophe.", "Thanks to the region's annual cycle of wet winters and arid summers, most of California's ecosystems incorporate wildfires into their natural rhythms. Historically, wildfires have facilitated the germination of many California plants and prevented the overgrowth of vegetation, but recent conditions have deviated far from the historical norm. A century of misguided fire suppression allowed the state's forests and chaparrals to grow far too dense -- providing a superabundance of wildfire fuel. A changing climate now extends California's dry season further into the fall months, when high winds afflict the state. This combination has exposed much of modern California to some of the most savage infernos known to history.", "As the authors write, an abnormally long dry season in 2018 left the countryside \"desiccated\" and \"as dry as tinder.\" It began with below-average rainfall during the 2017-18 rainy season and extended, with little respite, through the first week of November 2018. On the night of Nov. 7-8, the dominant west winds reversed, pouring out of the Great Basin to the east and raging over the Sierra Nevada. \"Gusts upwards of 50 mph,\" we are told, \"swept down over the foothills.\"", "Seven miles east of Paradise, a hydroelectric power line owned by the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. ran through a rugged canyon. A series of towers, each almost a century old, held the line aloft. Shortly after 6 a.m., a powerful wind broke a hook high up on an arm of one tower. A live wire fell. PG&E experienced a power outage on the line at 6:15 a.m. Thirteen minutes later, a supervisor \"saw a fire that he estimated to measure 100 square feet in a clearing below the transmission line.\" Fire Chief Matt McKenzie and his small crew approached the scene in another quarter of an hour, but realized the fire was on the far side of the canyon, separated by an impassible river. His team couldn't get closer to the flames without a precarious 40-minute detour. To Mr. McKenzie, a 20-year veteran of the state's firefighting agency, the burgeoning conflagration looked like \"a fire with enormous potential.\"", "Fierce, gusty winds whipped the fire into an uncontrollable beast and sent it straight toward Paradise. Satellites clocked the fiery monster at speeds of up to 21 miles an hour, \"faster than the previously posited maximum for wildfire spread.\"", "Paradise sent its first automated alert at 7:57 a.m. Five minutes later, officials \"ordered the mandatory evacuation of the entire town.\" Fewer than half of Paradise's 27,000 inhabitants, however, had opted into the town's alert network, and in the town's eastern neighborhoods -- the ones first hit by the fire -- more than half of those alerts failed. Many residents' first notification came as the fire itself charged into their area. Although the authors credit Paradise as one of the \"surprisingly few\" California towns with \"a decent evacuation plan,\" no one had envisioned a scenario in which they'd have to evacuate the entire town simultaneously.", "Chaos ensued. Traffic and flames overwhelmed the town's primary evacuation arteries. Flames tore through lines of immobilized cars. People fled on foot. Firefighters, police officers, public servants and members of the general public all made heroic attempts to save their fellow citizens. Joe Kennedy, a bulldozer operator for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, helped two nurses fleeing the town hospital into his cab. Fires burned through dozens of \"seemingly abandoned vehicles\" that blocked their escape. Inside several, he could see \"what appeared to be the burned bodies of people who had not been able to get out in time.\" He steeled himself and rammed the cars aside with the blade of his bulldozer.", "By 10 a.m., less than four hours after ignition, the fire had consumed more than nine square miles. The front of the main fire rampaged across the thoroughfare running through the center of Paradise. Meanwhile, \"the death toll was starting to mount.\" Most escaped. Many did not. Some time that night, Paradise, Calif., ceased to exist.", "By the time a rainstorm finally extinguished the blaze 17 days later, the fire had killed 85 people, incinerated more than 200 square miles and destroyed upward of 14,000 homes. Blame for the disaster quickly descended upon PG&E. As the federal judge overseeing the utility's probation stemming from a 2010 wildfire pointed out, PG&E had paid $4.5 billion worth of dividends to its stockholders during the five years prior to the Paradise fire rather than prioritize badly needed and long-deferred maintenance.", "California's governor at the time, Jerry Brown, warned earlier in 2018 that such horrendous wildfires are part of California's \"new normal.\" Mr. Gee and Ms. Anguiano cite three fire researchers who fear that Mr. Brown understated the crisis.

American foreign policy in the 21st century has been even more erratic than usual. The Sept. 11 attacks led President George W. Bush to proclaim a global war on terror. In 2008, Barack Obama was elected in large part on his record of opposition to the Iraq war Mr. Bush launched. President Obama negotiated three high-profile international agreements: the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, designed to limit Iran's nuclear activities; the Trans-Pacific Partnership, aimed at pre-emptively setting up economic rules for Pacific Rim countries that would constrain China; and the Paris climate accord, envisioned as the first step in a globally coordinated campaign to limit the emission of greenhouse gases.", "\nDonald Trump ran against all three and proclaimed an \"America first\" foreign policy that sought to upend decades of U.S. trade and alliance policy.

While the current president views existing international architecture with suspicion, Mr. Biden would likely see it as an indispensable element in building an effective international approach to Beijing. A Biden administration would not share Mr. Trump's willingness to disrupt relations with both European and Asian allies, and it would attempt to smooth relations with important U.S. allies like Japan, South Korea and Germany. But Mr. Biden's White House would likely combine any friendliness with a new emphasis on human rights and a skepticism about the value of trade -- which could lead to some interesting conversations with regional powers including Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and even India.", "On Iran, most Democratic foreign-policy experts regret Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA, but there is less consensus on what to do going forward. So many things have changed since 2017 in Iran and the region that simply returning to the status quo ante Trump is unrealistic. The unilateral sanctions the Trump administration imposed on Iran may not have brought Tehran back to the bargaining table on the president's terms, but a Biden administration might not want to give up the leverage those sanctions provide without receiving something from Iran in return.", "Foreign policy is, above all, grappling with the unpredictable.
